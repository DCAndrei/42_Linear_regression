# 42_Linear_regression
A first dive into the ML specialization

My first project in the ML field, with a simple linear regression training model with 1 feature

Inputs: A csv file with prices for cars depending on their mileage

Objectives: Train a model with the input data, and return the parameters of the regression

Output: Price prediction based on the parameters from the training model

Limitation: Because the training data is small, for mileages above 400k or close to 0k, the model does not work

Project was done in Jupyter notebook, the optimal alpha and number of itererations was determined based on the convergeance of the cost function
